# Nightmare of Ashihama Tracker

A plugin for tracking the following data at the Nightmare of Ashihama:

- Loot, both uniques and normal.
- Group size
- Kill times (with splits for each phase)
- Parasites spawned

This plugin is in active development and is built by the [RuneLog](https://runelog.com/?ref=github) team.

## Group size

We determine the group size by the remaining players left in the instance at the end of the fight. This is to avoid alts being used to resupply or people that die before the end of the encounter counting towards the group size. 

## Split timing

Splits are organised into the following:

- **P1**: From when Nightmare wakes up to the totems being fully charged.
- **P2**: From the P1 totems being fully charged to the P2 totems being fully charged.
- **P3**: From the P2 totems being fully charged to the Nightmare KC appearing in chat.

## Issues

If you experience any issues or have a feature request, please open an issue within the repository.
